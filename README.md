# project_get_clean_data
Description: This is the project for the course 'getting and cleaning data' in Coursera
'run_analysis.R' is the sript you may refer to, cleandata.txt is the file you can get by using the script
To do the anaylsis, simply source the code and type "run_analysis("UCI HAR Dataset") to run, like this:

> source('run_analysis.R')
> run_analysis("UCI HAR Dataset")

You may change the directory name. In that case, "UCI HAR Dataset" should be replaced by the new name of the directory
The results will be generated in a txt file called "cleandata.txt" in your work directory
Because the data is big, maybe you have to wait for some time to get the result
